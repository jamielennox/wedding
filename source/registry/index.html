<p>
If you would like to get us a gift, please consider gifting us an experience rather than a physical item.
We have been living together for a couple of years now and so are pretty set in terms of a household.
</p>
<p>
After the wedding, we are spending 4 weeks in Morocco and Gibraltar and the memories of these experiences will last us a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
Our registry is a honeymoon registry on Wanderable.
Wanderable is a great site that lets you put money towards a specific experience on the honeymoon.

<p>You can find the registry here:</p>
